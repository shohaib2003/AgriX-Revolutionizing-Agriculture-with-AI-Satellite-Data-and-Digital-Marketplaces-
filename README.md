      AgriX is an integrated AI-driven platform developed to empower Bangladeshi farmers with practical tools: satellite-based soil and moisture analysis, on-device machine-learning crop disease detection, a bilingual (Bangla/English/Banglish) advisory chatbot, and a direct farmer-to-buyer digital marketplace. The system focuses on real-world usability in resource-constrained rural settings—improving crop planning, early disease intervention, and fair market access. This repository was actively maintained during the report preparation by <strong>Group - 3</strong> and the work addresses the Software Engineering course outcomes <strong>CO3</strong> and <strong>CO4</strong>.

      For contributors and reviewers: the repo contains the project report, source materials, and a README summarizing features and responsibilities. Designed for clarity and impact—because farmers deserve technology that actually helps, not more tabs to juggle.
